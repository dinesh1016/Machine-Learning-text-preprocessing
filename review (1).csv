Picture quality, it's not expected as what brightness level is given in the specs, 500 nits, not at all, it just a marketing gimmick, actual brightness is like 300-350 nits. 4K upscaling is good. HD view is great. RAM and ROM are less as compared to price, it is expensive, 16 GB ROM and 2 GB RAM would have been better.READ MORE"
